<h1>Denis Tchaouchev</h1>
<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science at Stanford University. My research interests are in international relations and formal theory. I am particularly interested in how technological change affects the frequency, conduct, and outcome of international conflict.</p>
<p>Prior to starting graduate school, I attended Columbia University, from which I received a B.A. in Computer Science and a B.A. in Political Science in 2019.</p>
<p>My C.V. can be viewed <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/nns57kgw8u77rr27aluhz/Tchaouchev_CV092023.pdf?rlkey=so8dlvp2nhfz6uf9hmibb6141&dl=0"> here.</a></p>
